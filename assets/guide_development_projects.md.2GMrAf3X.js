By focusing on decentralized data processing, the FLAME (Federated Learning and Analyses in Medicine) platform ensures sensitive data remains protected, with only analysis algorithms and results exchanged. Supported by 17 partner institutions, PrivateAIM is developing a platform for federated learning that integrates cutting-edge privacy-preserving technologies. This collaboration aims to advance medical research, maintain high data security standards, and improve patient care outcomes.</p><ul><li><strong>Demo</strong>: <a href="https://privateaim.dev" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">privateaim.dev</a></li><li><strong>GitHub</strong>: <a href="https://github.com/PrviateAIM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Organisation</a></li></ul><h3 id="dnpm-dip" tabindex="-1">DNPM: DIP <a class="header-anchor" href="#dnpm-dip" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;DNPM: DIP&quot;">​</a></h3><p><strong>Description</strong>:<br> In the context of the <strong>Deutsches Netzwerk für Personalisierte Medizin (DNPM)</strong>, a <strong>Data Integration Platform (DIP)</strong> and the associated IT infrastructure are being developed to enable advanced, personalized medical approaches.<br> The platform is built around harmonized core datasets of pseudonymized patient data stored decentrally across local data nodes. A web-based front-end facilitates data queries and coordination, enabling doctors, specialists, and researchers to collaborate effectively.</p><p>Key features of the platform include:</p><ul><li><strong>Broad Knowledge Base</strong>: Aggregates insights from molecularly diagnosed patients to evaluate therapy approaches and derive actionable medical options. Findings from experimental treatments are published to contribute to the broader medical community.</li><li><strong>Decentralized Data Nodes</strong>: Supports secure data sharing and scientific evaluations through a request-and-approval process managed by Data Use &amp; Access Committees.</li><li><strong>Patient Portal</strong>: Developed as part of this platform, it enhances collaboration and care coordination by providing visualizations of patient data to identify patterns and correlations, enabling faster and more informed decision-making.</li><li><strong>Future Integrations</strong>: Beyond its initial scope covering Molecular Tumor Boards (MTB) and Rare Diseases (RDs), the platform is designed to integrate additional applications like the Molecular Inflammation Board (MIB).</li></ul><p>This decentralized approach accelerates personalized treatment planning by aligning care strategies with individual patient characteristics, in line with the principles of precision medicine.</p><ul><li><strong>Demo</strong>: <a href="https://dnpm-dip.net" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">dnpm-dip.net</a></li><li><strong>GitHub</strong>: <a href="https://github.com/kohlbacherlab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Organisation</a></li></ul><hr><h2 id="add-your-project" tabindex="-1">Add Your Project <a class="header-anchor" href="#add-your-project" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Add Your Project&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Have you built a project that uses <strong>Authup</strong> as its authentication and authorization framework?<br> If so, consider showcasing it here!</p><p>To submit your project:</p><ol><li>Open a <a href="https://github.com/authup/authup/issues" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">GitHub issue</a> in the <strong>Authup</strong> repository.</li><li>Include a link to your project&#39;s repository and a brief description of how <strong>Authup</strong> is being used.</li><li>Upon review, your project can be added to this list to inspire and assist others.</li></ol>',17),n=[o];function s(d,l,c,p,h,u){return a(),t("div",null,n)}const f=e(i,[["render",s]]);export{m as __pageData,f as default};
