# What is Authup?

Authup is an easy to use yet powerful authentication & authorization system. It's modular design allow you to only
deploy the parts you need for your application and scale the system precisely as demands grow. You could for example run 
multiple instances of the REST API along a single instance of the UI and use a load balancer to distribute the load.

It comes with a fully featured admin panel giving you access to it's powerful REST API for user and permission
management via a beautiful UI.

Or it can be used as a headless system for which you may or may not implement your own user interface (when
using [Vue JS](https://vuejs.org/) you can choose from pre-built components for you own application).

Authup requires no external services and can be deployed on any system that
supports [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) but it can
be configured to use external databases like [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
and [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) or [Redis](https://redis.io/) for caching.
