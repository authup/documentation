# Redis

Redis is used for caching database queries if a connection to a redis server is configured.
Redis is also used to publish changes (create, update, delete) to domain entities using the pub-sub pattern, to which microservices can respond.

The environment variables in the .env file variant can also be provided via runtime environment.
