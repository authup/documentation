# Introduction

Authup can be operated in several ways.
- **`Bare Metal`**: Bare Metal is the term used to describe running Authup on the host system with NodeJs.
- **`Docker`**: Docker is the term used to describe running Authup in a virtual environment using Docker (**recommended**).

In addition, it is possible to configure Authup for the following database systems:
- **`Mysql`**
- **`Postgres`**
- **`Sqlite3`**

Furthermore, a Redis instance can be configured to enable features like caching.
