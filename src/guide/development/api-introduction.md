# API

The **Authup API** provides a powerful and flexible interface to integrate authentication and authorization capabilities into applications.  
This section of the Developer Guide offers an overview of the API's structure, its key workflows, and best practices for using it effectively.

## Swagger
The full API reference is available via the built-in Swagger documentation.  
Once the backend is running, the Swagger interface can be accessed at:
**http://<BACKEND_URL>/docs** (e.g. `http://localhost:3001/docs`)
