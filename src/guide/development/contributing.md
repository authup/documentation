# Introduction

The Authup Developer Guide is a comprehensive resource for developers 
trying to contribute to the Authup ecosystem.
Contributions are very welcome!

If you would like to participate in the project, 
there are some things to consider:
- [Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.md)
- [Submission Guidelines](submission-guidelines.md)
- [Workflow](workflow.md)

After that you are ready to setup the [development environment](quick-start)
on your local machine.
