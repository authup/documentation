# Backend

The **server-http** & **sever-database** package, which can be integrated into an existent application,
is the heart ðŸ§¡ of the authup ecosystem and is used by the **server** package, to provide a standalone solution. 

Therefore, it is important to decide if a [standalone](#standalone) or [extension](#extension) solution for backend side
is the right choice.

## Extension or Standalone?

### Standalone

To use authup as standalone application, read the [server](../../packages/server/index.md) package documentation for further usage.
There is also a docker image available for instant usage.

### Extension

To use authup as extension to an existent [routup](https://www.npmjs.com/package/routup)- & [typeorm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/typeorm)-application,
read the [server-core](../contributing/index.md) package documentation.

## Supporting Microservices

It is also possible to interact with the authup API from microservices.
Therefore, a [server-adapter](../development/javascript-adapter.md) library is provided,
to simplify the verification and validation process of external access.
It provides a middleware for http & socket based microservices.
